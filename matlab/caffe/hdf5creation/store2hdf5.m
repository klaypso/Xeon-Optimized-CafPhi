  % *data* is W*H*C*N matrix of images should be normalized (e.g. to lie between 0 and 1) beforehand
  % *label* is D*N matrix of labels (D labels per sample) 
  % *create* [0/1] specifies whether to create file newly or to append to previously created file, useful to store information in batches when a dataset is too big to be held
