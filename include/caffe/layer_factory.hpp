/**
 * @brief A layer factory that allows one to register layers.
 * During runtime, registered layers could be called by passing a LayerParameter
 * protobuffer to the CreateLayer function:
 *
 *     LayerRegistry<Dtype>::CreateLayer(param);
 *
 * There are two ways to register a layer. Assuming that we have a layer like:
 *
 *   template <typename Dtype>
 *   class MyAwesomeLayer : public Layer<Dtype> {
 *     // your implementations
 *   };
 *
 * and its type is its C++ class name, but without the "Layer" at the end
 * ("MyAwesomeLayer" -> "MyAwesome").
 *
 * If the layer is going to be created simply by its constructor, in your c++
 * file, add the following line:
 *
 *    REGISTER_LAYER_CLASS(MyAwesome);
 *
 * Or, if the layer is going to be created by another creator function, in the
 * format of:
 *
 *    template <typename Dtype>
 *    Layer<Dtype*> GetMyAwesomeLayer(const LayerParameter& param) {
 *      // your implementation
 *    }
 *
 * (for example, when your layer has multiple backends, see GetConvolutionLayer
 * for a use case), then you can register the creator function instead, like
 *
 * REGISTER_LAYER_CREATOR(MyAwesome, GetMyAwesomeLayer)
 *
 * Note that each layer type should only be registered once.
